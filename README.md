# Stock-Site
Users are able to create a login account which saves a transaction history of every "purchase and sale" of stock. The site performs a real-time lookup of the stock price.

### Improvements/Lessons to take for next project.
1. Rewrite source code to follow [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
2. Rewrite source code to also follow [PEP 257 -- Docstring Conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/).
3. Condense oversized functions into smaller and mor managable portions.

### Credit
Thanks to jacebrowning for creating [memgen](https://github.com/jacebrowning/memegen#special-characters), "an API to programatically generate memes based solely on requested URLs."
In this case it is used to memes along with HTTP status codes when the site encounters an error.
